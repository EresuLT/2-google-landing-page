# 2 - google-landing-page

Here is my second project. I made this website by using HTML & CSS. 
In this project, we simulate "Google's Landing Page" without backend side.
I learned how to shape website with HTML and CSS codes.


As an engineer, I was familiar with IT world but this step was one of my life changing step. 
I'm beginning to a journey which I'm planning to be a perfect Software Developer.
Let's move on...
